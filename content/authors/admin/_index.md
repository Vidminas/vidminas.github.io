Hi üëãüòä! I'm Vidminas (most people call me Vid), a PhD student in the [Institute of Language Cognition and Computation](https://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/ilcc) at the University of Edinburgh. My primary supervisor is [Fiona McNeill](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/fmcneill/).

I am looking for ways to improve search for educational resources, so that teachers in schools across the world can reuse each others' work instead of creating their own materials all the time.

Originally, I come from Lithuania, although I grew up in Luxembourg and moved to Edinburgh for my undegraduate degree in computer science and management science. I am always keen to chat about teaching, human-computer interaction, participatory research, and machine learning applications in education, feel free to get in touch!
