Open Educational Resources bring lots of benefits, but how can we implement them in practice? There is no 1 tool that ticks all the boxes for everyone, but we have produced several documents to help HE staff make decisions about what to use in their context.

I presented findings from our recent project "Set Them Free! Open Publishing of INF1B Course Materials" at the Edinburgh Learning and Teaching Conference.  In the University of Edinburgh School of Informatics case, we have begun development of an open courseware site using Drupal, which is now available at <https://opencourse.inf.ed.ac.uk/>.
