This project is about investigating the needs and challenges of primary and secondary school teachers in Scotland involved in finding, using, and sharing educational resources online. The first exploratory stage involves interviews with primary and secondary school teachers, teacher trainees, and other school staff to define the processes involved and how these processes are situated in teachersâ€™ work context. The second stage will be a review of existing tools that facilitate these tasks. Thirdly, iterative design and prototype evaluation studies will be carried out to experiment with potential improvements to online resource discoverability. This project is largely building on the previous work [Supporting the Discoverability of Open Educational Resources: On the Scent of a Hidden Treasury (2019)](https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/supporting-discoverability-open-educational/docview/2487999218/se-2?accountid=10673).
