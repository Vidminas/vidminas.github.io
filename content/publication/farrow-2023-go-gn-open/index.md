abstract: This Handbook draws together work done between 2020 and 2023 by members
  of the Global OER Graduate Network (GO-GN). GO-GN is a network of PhD candidates
  around the world whose research projects include a focus on open education. GO-GN
  is currently funded through the OER programme of The William and Flora Hewlett Foundation
  and administered by the Open Education Research Hub from the Institute of Educational
  Technology at The Open University, UK. In our current phase of activity, we began
  these collaborative writing efforts with a Research Methods Handbook which was created
  during the depths of the Covid-19 pandemic. Working together at distance provided
  an important way to strengthen community links when meeting in person was not possible.
  The Research Methods Handbook was well received by a much larger audience than we
  anticipated, and went on to win an Open Research Award.  We followed this up with
  a sister publication, our Conceptual Frameworks Guide. This explores a less well
  traversed (but nonetheless important) area of scholarly focus. Together, these two
  explore open approaches to the theory and practice of research in open education.
  One distinctive feature of our presentation is to foreground the authentic experiences
  of doctoral researchers who have used specific approaches in researching open education.  While
  it is not possible to cover all approaches in this detail, we hope that important
  insights are presented in this form of open practice. Throughout 2020-2022 we also
  regularly engaged our membership through collective reviews of recently published
  papers and articles. The Research Reviews serve as an overview of recent research
  but also as a snapshot of the critical responses recorded by doctoral and post-doctoral
  researchers working in relevant areas. No one volume can claim to comprehensively
  contain the diversity and variety of open approaches, and this is no exception.
  But one virtue of openness is that we can draw on the openly licensed works of others
  to increase our coverage of relevant areas. The Additional Resources at the end
  of this volume bring together a range of openly licensed texts on open education
  research and suggests places for further reading and research. Consequently, the
  information contained here represents a wide range of contributors and collaborators.  The
  original and intended audience for this volume is the doctoral student working on
  an open education research project - in short, the typical student member of GO-GN
  and the profile the network exists to support. However, we’ve learned through feedback
  and analytics that the potential audience for works like this is much larger. Many
  people who wouldn’t describe themselves as researchers still do research and evaluation.
  Presenting accessible insights into research foundations and practices helps with
  this and can be understood as a form of open practice.
